  Handle weird 3-way handshake(syn&ack -> syn -> ack)
- Handle weird 3-way handshake(syn&ack -> syn -> ack) I have pcaps from
  Cisco2960 span port and found some tcp handshake has weird order 3-way
  handshake. It seems first packet order between sessions is not
  guaranted for cisco span. maybe. Current state transition is
  INIT -- syn --> SYN1 -- syn&ack --> SYN2 -- ack --> ESTABLISHED New
  state transition starts with SYN1 or SYN2 and adds(revive actually)
  STATE_ACK to handle both cases. case1 : INIT -- syn --> SYN1 --
  syn&ack -->ACK -- ack --> ESTABLISHED (normal) case2 : INIT -- syn&ack
  --> SYN2 -- syn -->ACK -- ack --> ESTABLISHED (weird) [EaseTheWorld]
